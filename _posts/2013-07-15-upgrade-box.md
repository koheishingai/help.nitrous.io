At any point you can change the memory/storage configuration of your
boxes. After creating a box with 384MB of memory and you
realize that you need more memory for your (say) Java application, then you can upgrade the memory configuration of your box without having to create a new box.


## Upgrading a Box

Look for the 'Settings' button (after clicking on your box name) in your [box dashboard](https://www.nitrous.io/app).

Clicking on that link will take you to your Box Settings page, where you can move the memory and storage sliders to the right to increase the memory and storage configurations your box.

This screen will also give you your current memory and storage usage as well.

Hit *Save Changes* to apply your changes to the box.

Your box will undergo a reboot, so please remember to save your work
before you upgrade your box.


## Downgrading a Box

Follow the same instructions to get to the Settings page for your
box.

Move the memory/storage sliders to the left to reduce the
memory/storage configurations on your box.

If you have used up more storage than your target storage, then
please note that you will not be able to reduce your storage
allocation.
