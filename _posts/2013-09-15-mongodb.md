This guide walks through how you can setup a MongoDB database on your Nitrous.IO box.

### Prerequisites

* Nitrous.IO box with the package manager Autoparts installed. To ensure Autoparts is installed, run the command `parts` within the terminal. Take a look at the [Autoparts guide](/autoparts/) for installation instructions.

### Installing MongoDB

To install MongoDB with the autoparts package manager, run the following command:

    parts install mongodb

### Configuring MongoDB for a Rails App

When building a Rails app, run the following command to skip active record and test unit:

    rails new myapp --skip-active-record --skip-test-unit

Rails 4 requires the latest version of `mongoid`, which also includs `bson_ext` as a dependency. Add the following lines to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'mongoid', git: 'https://github.com/mongoid/mongoid.git'
    gem 'bson_ext'

Run `bundle install` after you have updated your Gemfile, and generate the configuration.

    rails g mongoid:config
