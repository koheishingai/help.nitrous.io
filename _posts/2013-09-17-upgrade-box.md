This guide covers how to check your Nitrous box version and how to update.

>If you are looking to increase/decrease the amount of memory or storage on your existing box, please view the [Configuring Box Memory & Storage](/box-settings) guide.

### Checking Current Version

To view which version your Nitrous box is running on, navigate to the [boxes page](https://www.nitrous.io/app#/boxes). From there, expand your Nitrous box to view the stack information.

The screenshot below displays a `bran` box. Some packages may not work correctly in the previous box version, `arya`.

### Upgrading the Nitrous Box

In order to obtain the latest box version, you will need to [create a new box](/box-new). 

If you need to terminate an existing box to utilize the N2O for a new box, you may first want to download your project data. View the [Upload an Existing Application](/faq-adding-project/) guide for information on how to transfer projects to and from your Nitrous box via SFTP or Git.

You can terminate an existing box by navigating to the [boxes page](https://www.nitrous.io/app#/boxes), and from there you will need to select `Shut Down` followed by `Terminate` on the box you intend to delete.
