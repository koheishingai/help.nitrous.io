published: true
categories: [databases]

### Prerequisites

* Nitrous.IO box with the package manager Autoparts installed. To ensure Autoparts is installed, run the command `parts` within the terminal. Take a look at the [Autoparts guide](/autoparts/) for installation instructions.

### Install MySQL

You can quickly install MySQL using Autoparts. Within the terminal, run the following command to install:

    parts install mysql

### Connecting via Rails

Once MySQL is installed, Rails will automatically create a database when creating a new app. View our [Rails 4 guide](http://blog.nitrous.io/2013/07/02/building-a-rails-4.0-app-on-nitrous-io.html) for information on building an app.

Here is the configuration necessary to connect to your local MySQL database:

In `config/database.yml`:

    development:
      adapter: sqlite3
      database: db/development.sqlite3
      pool: 5
      timeout: 5000

    test:
      adapter: sqlite3
      database: db/test.sqlite3
      pool: 5
      timeout: 5000

    production:
      adapter: sqlite3
      database: db/production.sqlite3
      pool: 5
      timeout: 5000
