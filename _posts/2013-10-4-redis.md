title: Setting up Redis with Autoparts

### Prerequisites

* Nitrous.IO box with the package manager Autoparts installed. To ensure Autoparts is installed, run the command `parts` within the terminal. Take a look at the [Autoparts guide](/autoparts/) for installation instructions.

### Install Redis

You can quickly install Redis using Autoparts. Within the terminal, run the following command to install:

    parts install redis

### Connecting via Rails

Within your Rails app, update your Gemfile to include the [redis-rb](http://github.com/redis/redis-rb) client:

    gem 'redis'

From here you will want to install the gem via Bundler:

    bundle install

Next, create an initializer in `config/initializers/redis.rb` and add the following:

    $redis = Redis.new(:host => 'localhost', :port => 6379)

This will create a new instance of the Redis client, which is stored as the global variable $redis.

You can now test Redis by setting and getting keys. Run `rails console` followed by these commands:

    > $redis
    => #<Redis client v2.1.1 connected to redis://localhost:6379/0 (Redis v2.6.16)>
    > $redis.set('christopher', 'walken')
    => "OK" 
    > $redis.get('christopher')
    => "walken"
