    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Uploading files to Nitrous.IO is quick and easy. There&#8217;s no need to FTP or SCP files to your development box (although you can, if you want to).</p>
<p class='alert'>This article describes how to upload individual files. If you need to upload an entire project / complex directory structure, please read [this article]()</p>
<p>In the file browser, right-click the destination directory where you&#8217;d like to upload the image and click &#8220;Upload files to <span>your folder name</span>&#8221;.</p>

<p><img alt='Directory Menu' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/file-uploads-1.png' /></p>

<p>A file upload modal will appear, where you can drag &amp; drop multiple files or browse for files manually. You can upload a bunch of files at once, so feel free to add up to 5 files at a time.</p>

<p><img alt='File Upload Modal' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/file-uploads-2.png' /></p>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve dropped the files you want to upload, click the &#8220;Upload&#8221; button at the bottom right-hand side of the modal.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll see the status of each file uploaded via the progress bar to the right of the filename.</p>

<div class='alert alert-notice'>
  We support .png, .jpeg, .gif, and .pdf file uploads
</div>
<p>After each file is uploaded successfully, the modal will disapear and you&#8217;ll be back in the Nitrous.IO IDE. The file browser should refresh automatically and you should see your uploaded files in the correct directory.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t see the files you&#8217;ve uploaded, you can right click and select &#8220;Refresh&#8221; to refresh the contents of a folder, or click the refresh icon at the top of the file browser to refresh the entire tree.</p>

<p>If you want to view an image in the browser, simply click the image to open a preview tab inside of the web ide.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it! Of course, if you&#8217;re having any trouble, you can always <a href='mailto:support@nitrous.io?subject=File%20Uploads'>get in touch with a human</a>.</p>]]></content>
