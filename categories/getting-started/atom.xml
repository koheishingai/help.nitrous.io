    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We get a lot of emails asking how to upload applications to an Nitrous.IO box. There are a few ways you can do this:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href='#sftp'>SFTP</a></li>

<li><a href='#git'>Git</a></li>
</ul>
<a href='#' id='sftp' />
<h3 id='uploading_your_project_via_sftp'>Uploading your project via SFTP</h3>

<p>Uploading via SFTP requires that you have set up your public / private keypair on your machine and added your public key to Nitrous.IO. To do this, we recommend that you use PuttyGen. Visit this link and look for the PuttyGen download:</p>

<p><a href='http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html'>http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html</a></p>

<p><img alt='PuTTYgen' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/puttygen.png' /></p>

<p>Click the <strong>PuTTYgen.exe</strong> link to download the application.</p>

<p>Open PuTTYgen and click the <strong>Generate</strong> button next to &#8220;Generate a public/private keypair&#8221;.</p>

<p><img alt='keygen button' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/putty-keygen.png' /></p>

<p>You&#8217;ll be asked to move your mouse around to help PuTTY generate a random keypair for you.</p>

<p><img alt='keygen random' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/putty-random.png' /></p>

<p>Once your keys are generated, you&#8217;ll want to save them someplace private. Click the &#8220;Save Public Key&#8221; and &#8220;Save Private Key&#8221; buttons to save the files.</p>

<p><img alt='putty save keys' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/putty-key.png' /></p>

<p>PuTTY will automatically save the private key as a .ppk file, which is a putty private key file that contains some additional encoded information about your key. Keep the .ppk extension for this file.</p>

<p>Name the public key something like <strong>public_key.pub</strong> and the private key <strong>private_key.ppk</strong> and save them someplace safe.</p>
<p class='note'>You want to save these keys someplace safe because if someone were to find your private key, they could authenticate with any services where you utilize public key authentication.</p>
<p>Okay, so now we have our keypairs set up, let&#8217;s go ahead and add our public keys to Nitrous.IO.</p>

<ol>
<li>Signin to your <a href='https://nitrous.io'>Nitrous.IO</a> account</li>

<li>Click the &#8220;Public Keys&#8221; link in the top navigation</li>

<li>Create a name for your public key &#8211; something that identifies the machine. I&#8217;ll use &#8220;AJ&#8217;s Windows XP&#8221;.</li>

<li>Paste your public key in the text area.</li>
</ol>

<p><img alt='action key' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/win-key.png' /></p>

<h3 id='download_sftp_client'>Download SFTP Client</h3>

<p>Next, you&#8217;ll need to download an SFTP client. For this article we&#8217;ll use <a href='http://filezilla-project.org/'>Filezilla</a>, but if you&#8217;re on a Mac you can also check out <a href='http://panic.com/transmit/'>Transmit</a>. Filezilla is free, so go ahead and download it now.</p>

<p><img alt='filezilla download' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/sftp/filezilla-win-download.png' /></p>

<p>Now we need to tell Filezilla to connect via SSH using our SSH keypair that we just generated. First, click <strong>Edit &gt; Settings</strong> in the top menu.</p>

<p><img alt='filezilla settings' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/sftp/filezilla-settings.png' /></p>

<p>Once in the settings pane, click <strong>Connection &gt; FTP &gt; SFTP</strong> and click the <strong>Add keyfile&#8230;</strong> button.</p>

<p><img alt='filezilla settings sftp' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/sftp/filezilla-sftp.png' /></p>

<p>Then we&#8217;ll want to add the private key that we just created and put in our safe folder.</p>

<p><img alt='filezilla settings sftp privatekey' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/sftp/filezilla-privatekey.png' /></p>

<p>Then click the <strong>OK</strong> button.</p>

<h3 id='setup_site_profile_to_connect_to_nitrousio'>Setup site profile to connect to Nitrous.IO</h3>

<p>Ok, now that we&#8217;ve added the key to Filezilla, lets go ahead and add the connection details.</p>

<h4 id='1_click_file__site_manager_in_the_application_menu'>1. Click File &gt; Site Manager in the application menu</h4>

<p><img alt='filezilla site manager' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/sftp/filezilla-sitemanager.png' /></p>

<h4 id='2_click_the_new_site_button_and_name_the_connection_profile_im_going_to_name_it_the_same_as_my_box_on_nitrousio'>2. Click the <strong>New Site</strong> button and name the connection profile. I&#8217;m going to name it the same as my box on Nitrous.IO</h4>

<p><img alt='filezilla new site' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/sftp/filezilla-newsite.png' /></p>

<h4 id='3_type_in_action_as_the_username_and_the_relevant_host_and_port_information_from_your_box_details_page_on_nitrousio'>3. Type in <strong>action</strong> as the username and the relevant <strong>host</strong> and <strong>port</strong> information from your box details page on Nitrous.IO:</h4>

<p><img alt='filezilla box details' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/sftp/box-details.png' /></p>

<ul>
<li>Protocol: SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol</li>

<li>Logon Type: Normal</li>

<li>User: action</li>

<li>Password: <span>leave blank</span></li>

<li>Account: <span>leave blank</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Then click the <strong>Connect</strong> button. You might see an alert box telling you the host is unknown. Click the checkbox to let filezilla know this is a trusted host, and click OK.</p>

<p><img alt='filezilla unknown host' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/sftp/host-unknown.png' /></p>

<p>You&#8217;ll see the connection details streaming in the filezilla status menu and then you should see that you&#8217;re all connected! Congratulations!</p>

<p><img alt='filezilla connected' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/sftp/filezilla-connected.png' /></p>
<a href='#' id='git' />
<h3 id='uploading_your_project_via_git'>Uploading your project via Git</h3>

<p>If you have git installed on your machine, you can easily push a code repository to github (or another repository hosting service), then clone the repository on your Nitrous.IO box.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

<ul>
<li>Installed <a href='http://git-scm.com/'>Git</a></li>

<li>Working knowledge of <a href='http://try.github.com/levels/1/challenges/1'>Git commands</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Read this article about how to connect your github account to Nitrous.IO:</p>

<p><strong>Mac:</strong> <a href='/github-add-key'>Adding your keys to Github</a></p>

<p><strong>Windows:</strong> <a href='/ssh-windows'>Adding SSH Keys on Windows</a></p>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve successfully setup your SSH keys, you can easily clone repositories from Github to your Nitrous.IO boxes.</p>]]></content>

    <link href="/N2O"/>

    <id>/N2O</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Your N2O defines the total resources available to you on the Nitrous.IO platform.</p>

<p>Memory and storage each cost a specific number of N2O units, but you are free to decide whether you want to increase your Memory consumption or your Storage consumption.</p>

<p>This enables considerably more flexibility than the traditional &#8220;Plan&#8221; system. Instead of being forced into a plan that doesn&#8217;t quite fit your needs, you can purchase or earn more N2O and use it to upgrade your resources.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s look at an example. Our free accounts get 150 units of N2O, which is enough for 384MB of Memory and 750 MB of Storage. This is enough for a base box on Nitrous.IO (these also happen to be the lowest possible resources on any single box).</p>

<p><img alt='Resource Sliders' src='/screenshots/resources.png' /></p>

<p>With additional N2O, you can upgrade either your Memory in 128MB units, or you Storage in 250MB units. So if you want 1GB of Memory, but don&#8217;t need the storage, you would only need to pay for the increase in Memory.</p>

<p>Lets say you want (2) 512MB boxes, that&#8217;s easy to do as well. Just make sure you have the N2O in your account, and you&#8217;re able to increase the resources on both of your boxes.</p>

<p>Assuming you have enough N2O in your account, you can create (almost) any number of boxes each configured how you need them.</p>]]></content>
