    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>SSH Keys enable you to manage your Action boxes directly from your computer via your favorite SSH client. The keypair is used to identify you when interacting with your box from outside of <a href='https://www.nitrous.io'>our website</a>.</p>
<ul class='inline choices'>
  <li><a href='//ssh/mac/public-keys/ssh-add.html'>Mac</a></li>
  <li class='selected'>Windows</li>
</ul>
<p>On Windows, we recommend that you use <a href='http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html'>PuttyGen</a>. Visit this link and look for the PuttyGen download:</p>

<p><a href='http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html'>http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html</a></p>

<p><img alt='PuTTYgen' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/puttygen.png' /></p>

<p>Click the <strong>PuTTYgen.exe</strong> link to download the application.</p>

<p>Open PuTTYgen and click the <strong>Generate</strong> button next to &#8220;Generate a public/private keypair&#8221;.</p>

<p><img alt='keygen button' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/putty-keygen.png' /></p>

<p>You&#8217;ll be asked to move your mouse around to help PuTTY generate a random keypair for you.</p>

<p><img alt='keygen random' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/putty-random.png' /></p>

<p>Once your keys are generated, you&#8217;ll want to save them someplace private. Click the &#8220;Save Public Key&#8221; and &#8220;Save Private Key&#8221; buttons to save the files.</p>

<p><img alt='putty save keys' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/putty-key.png' /></p>

<p>PuTTY will automatically save the private key as a .ppk file, which is a putty private key file that contains some additional encoded information about your key. Keep the .ppk extension for this file.</p>

<p>Name the public key something like <strong>public_key.pub</strong> and the private key <strong>private_key.ppk</strong> and save them someplace safe.</p>
<p class='note'>You want to save these keys someplace safe because if someone were to find your private key, they could authenticate with any services where you utilize public key authentication.</p>
<p>Okay, so now we have our keypairs set up, let&#8217;s go ahead and add our public keys to Nitrous.IO.</p>

<ol>
<li>Signin to your <a href='https://www.nitrous.io'>Nitrous.IO</a> account</li>

<li>Click the &#8220;Public Keys&#8221; link in the top navigation</li>

<li>Create a name for your public key &#8211; something that identifies the machine. I&#8217;ll use &#8220;AJ&#8217;s Windows XP&#8221;.</li>

<li>Paste your public key in the text area and click <strong>Add Key</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p><img alt='action key' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/win-key.png' /></p>

<p>Now let&#8217;s connect to one of our development boxes. For this, we&#8217;re going to use the <a href='http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/'>PuTTY SSH client</a>.</p>

<p><img alt='putty download' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/putty/putty-dl.png' /></p>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve downloaded, open up the application. On the left pane, you&#8217;ll need to navigate down to <strong>Connection &gt; SSH &gt; Auth</strong></p>

<p><img alt='putty auth' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/putty/putty-auth.png' /></p>

<p>Now we&#8217;re going to tell PuTTY where to find our private key. Click on the <strong>Browse</strong> button, and navigate to the safe folder where you saved your public key above.</p>

<p><img alt='putty key' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/putty/putty-privatekey.png' /></p>

<p>Select your private key, and click <strong>Open</strong></p>

<p>Back on the PuTTY pane, click <strong>Session</strong> at the top. You&#8217;ll see all of the required connection information. You&#8217;ll need to type in your hostname, port, and make sure the connection type is set to SSH. You can find the hostname and port information on the <a href='https://www.nitrous.io/boxes'>Nitrous.IO</a> website in the box details pane.</p>

<p>Your hostname will be something like: <strong>apse1.actionbox.io</strong> and your port will be at the end of the string after the colon:</p>

<p><img alt='box details' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/sftp/box-details.png' /></p>

<p>You&#8217;ll probably want to enter a name into the input under the <strong>Saved Sessions</strong> label. Since the box I&#8217;m connecting to is called Bonzai on Nitrous.IO, I&#8217;m going to call this session &#8220;Bonzai&#8221; and click Save to save the session to my list of saved profiles.</p>

<p>Now, let&#8217;s try out the connection. With our Bonzai profile loaded, click the <strong>Open</strong> link at the bottom of the window. An SSH terminal should appear. When it asks you who to login as, just type &#8220;action&#8221;. This is the common user for free boxes.</p>

<pre><code>login as: action</code></pre>

<p>Then hit enter, and you should see the message:</p>

<pre><code>Authenticating with public key &quot;rsa-key-[date]&quot;</code></pre>

<p>And we&#8217;ll see that we&#8217;re successfully connected to our box!</p>

<p><img alt='connected' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/putty/putty-term.png' /></p>

<p>Of course, if you&#8217;re having trouble, you can always <a href='mailto:support@nitrous.io?subject=SSH%20Key%20Issues%20Windows'>talk to a real human</a>.</p>]]></content>

<ul class='inline choices'>
  <li class='selected'>Mac</li>
  <li><a href='//ssh/public-keys/windows/ssh-windows.html'>Windows</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id='1_generate_a_public_key'>1: Generate a public key</h3>

<p>On your <strong>personal computer</strong> enter the code below. We want the default settings so when asked to enter a file in which to save the key, just press enter.</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -C &quot;your_email@youremail.com&quot;
# Creates a new ssh key using the provided email

# Generating public/private rsa key pair.
# Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa): [Press enter]</code></pre>

<p>Now you enter a passphrase (passphrases make things more secure).</p>

<pre><code># Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
# Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
Which should give you something like this:

# Your identification has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.
# Your public key has been saved in /Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
# The key fingerprint is:
# 01:0f:f4:3b:ca:85:d6:17:a1:7d:f0:68:9d:f0:a2:db your_email@youremail.com</code></pre>

<h3 id='2_adding_keys_to_nitrousio'>2: Adding keys to Nitrous.IO</h3>

<p>Run the following code to copy the key to your clipboard.</p>

<pre><code>pbcopy &lt; ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Copies the contents of the id_rsa.pub file to your clipboard</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you copy the key <em>exactly</em> without newlines or whitespace. The pbcopy command helps copy just the contents with no extraneous characters.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t have the pbcopy command, copy the output of the following command:</p>

<pre><code>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code></pre>

<p>Next, Login to your Nitrous.IO account and click &#8220;Public Keys&#8221; in the top right navigation. You shouldn&#8217;t have any keys listed if this is the first key you are adding. Click the &#8220;Add Public key&#8221; button:</p>

<p><img alt='Public Key Button' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/add-public-key-button.png' /></p>

<p>Next, add a name for the SSH key e.g. &#8220;AJ&#8217;s MBA&#8221;. This is helpful to identify which machines you&#8217;ve given access to your action boxes, so make it descriptive.</p>

<p>Then, paste your key into the &#8220;Key&#8221; field that you copied in section 2. of the article and click the &#8220;Add key&#8221;.</p>

<p><img alt='Public Key Form' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/public-key-form.png' /></p>

<h3 id='3_make_sure_it_works'>3. Make sure it works</h3>

<p>To make sure everything works we&#8217;ll now SSH into your box. You&#8217;ll be asked to authenticate this action using your password, which is the passphrase you created earlier.</p>

<p>Click the &#8220;boxes&#8221; link in the top navigation. Then click any box you&#8217;ve created to expand its details:</p>

<p><img alt='Box Details' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/box-details.png' /></p>

<p>Click the SSH URI link, it should look something like the link in the screenshot above.</p>

<p>Your browser will attempt to open a local terminal session. If there&#8217;s a prompt like this, just click &#8220;Allow&#8221;:</p>

<p><img alt='SSH Prompt' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/ssh-confirm-prompt.png' /></p>

<p>In your terminal, you might see something like this:</p>

<pre><code>The authenticity of host &#39;[apse1.actionbox.io]:10253    ([54.251.42.128]:10253)&#39; can&#39;t be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 57:b7:dd:50:04:09:e8:f8:e5:93:e1:2d:2f:46:a5:f5.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes</code></pre>

<p>Don&#8217;t worry, this is supposed to happen. Verify that the fingerprint matches the one here and type &#8220;yes&#8221;. This will add your Action box to your known_hosts ssh file.</p>

<pre><code>Warning: Permanently added &#39;[apse1.actionbox.io]:10253, [54.251.42.128]:10253&#39; (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
Welcome to Nitrous.IO (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-31-virtual x86_64)</code></pre>

<p>Now you&#8217;ve got your SSH keys setup so you can connect via Terminal / PuTTY and use Vim or Emacs to code!</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For those developers using <a href='http://github.com'>Github</a>, Action lets you easily add your box&#8217;s ssh keys so managing your repositories is a breeze.</p>

<h3 id='1_connect_your_github_account'>1. Connect your Github Account</h3>

<p>First, you&#8217;ll need to authenticate your Github account so we&#8217;re allowed to add ssh keys to your profile on Github.</p>

<p>In the top navigation, click the username dropdown on the right and select &#8220;Account Settings&#8221;</p>

<p><img alt='Account Settings Menu' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/menu-account-settings.png' /></p>

<p>On the Account Settings page, click the &#8220;Connect to Github&#8221; button.</p>

<p><img alt='Connect to Github' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/github-connect-button.png' /></p>

<p>You&#8217;ll be redirected to the Github authentication page, where you can review the policies and select &#8220;Allow&#8221;.</p>

<p>You will then be redirected back to Nitrous.IO and you should see a message that you&#8217;ve authenticated successfully. If you&#8217;re having trouble, send us an email.</p>

<h3 id='2_add_box_ssh_key_to_github'>2. Add Box SSH Key to Github</h3>

<p>Now that you&#8217;ve successfully authenticated your Github account, you&#8217;ll be able to add your SSH keys from your Nitrous.IO to your Github account. This will allow you to easily work with your repositories on Github.</p>

<p>Navigate back to the Boxes page, by clicking the &#8220;Boxes&#8221; link in the top navigation.</p>

<p>Click any of your boxes to toggle it&#8217;s details and click the &#8220;Reveal Public Key&#8221; link.</p>

<p><img alt='Reveal Public Key' src='https://raw.github.com/action-io/action-assets/master/support/screenshots/reveal-public-key.png' /></p>

<p>Once your public key is revealed, you simply need to click the &#8220;Add to Github&#8221; link to the right of the key. After a few seconds, you should see the link be replaced with a status message that reads &#8220;Added to Github!&#8221;</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s it! Keys on Github will be named &#8220;actionio-<span>boxname</span>&#8221;.</p>

<h3 id='3_confirming_key_is_added_optional'>3. Confirming Key is Added (Optional)</h3>

<p>If you want to confirm that your SSH key from your action box has been added to Github or want to remove the key, sign in to your Github account and click the &#8220;Account Settings&#8221; link in the top right navigation and then &#8220;SSH Keys&#8221; on the left nav.</p>

<p><em>Account Settings&#160;&#187; SSH Keys</em></p>

<p>You should see the key you added via Nitrous.IO.</p>
